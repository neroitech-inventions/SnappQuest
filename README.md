### Mission

> **To unlock opportunities for everyday contributors by rewarding meaningful participation through fast, fun, and verified quests, bridging talent and builders through micro-engagement.**

SnappQuest makes it easy for anyone to **contribute to the Solana ecosystem**, grow their **visibility**, and get paid for **proof of effort**.

---

### The Problem

Despite the accessibility of freelance work in the Solana ecosystem, there are still gaps for:

* **Contributors with no visibility yet**
* **Communities showing effort but not winning bounties**

At the same time, builders and projects struggle to:

* Scale **meaningful community engagement**
* Reward **early supporters** who amplify, test, and share
* Keep **contributors active** between projects

---

### The Solution: SnappQuest

SnappQuest is a **Curated Micro-Quest platform** designed to incentivize **active participation** across the Solana ecosystem.

We reward contributors for doing the small things that help grow the ecosystem, such as:

* Trivia
* Feedback loops
* Social actions (likes, retweets, quotes, memes)
* Micro-content
* AMAs, onboarding tasks, and more

---

### How SnappQuest Works

1. **Projects or moderators** post Quests, tasks that drive **real community growth**.
2. **Verified contributors** complete Quests with **proof-of-effort** and basic checks.
3. **Rewards** are distributed, tracked for **reputation**, growth, and future access.

It's fast, lightweight, and designed for anyone in the ecosystem to start contributing today.
